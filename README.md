# 🌿 Natural Image Prediction using PCA & Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying natural image categories using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and traditional machine learning models for classification.

## 📁 Dataset
- Natural Images Dataset from Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images)

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- PCA for reducing image dimensionality
- ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree
- Accuracy comparison and explained variance visualization

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Colab)
- scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy

## ✅ Results
- Successfully predicted image classes with reduced dimensions
- Compared model performances for better understanding

## 📌 Note
This is a beginner-friendly project showing how dimensionality reduction can improve classification efficiency in image datasets.
